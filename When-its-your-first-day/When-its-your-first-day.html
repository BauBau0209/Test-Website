		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'; margin-left: 250px; margin-right: 250px">Hiii. Are you nervous? Excited? <br/> <br/>
        I feel like you'll answer "both". Eitherway, I'm excited for you. I hope you'll have a great time and you'll be able to find good company on your school. 
        I must have told you loads of tips already the moment na I heard mag sstart ka na soon so I won't tell you much here on this letter.
		<br/> <br/> Good luck on your studies. Please don't pressure yourself too much. One of the things that kuya taught me is that grades won't 
        matter as much when you're working already. As long as you graduate and you have the right skills and characteristics, you can do well on the adult world.
		<br/> <br/> Pero wag ka naman mag bulakbol. baka naman dahil sa sinabi ko hindi kana pumasok. Try to graduate with flying colors but don't ever be harsh 
        to yourself for not achieving things as much as you want. 
        <br/> <br/> Pero above all that, trust God na pagtatagumpayin ka niya sa school becuase you are loyal to him. 
        Just like how he gave me to you when you asked him, he can give you your dreams.
        <br/> <br/> I wish you good luck on your first day.
        <br/> <br/> Love, <br.> Your Eddielyn.
