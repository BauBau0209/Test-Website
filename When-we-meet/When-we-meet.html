		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'; margin-left: 250px; margin-right: 250px">Hi. I don't know if you'll still feel nervous when we're 
		finally about to meet but please hug me the second you see me.
		<br/> <br/>I might not be able to move when I first saw you so you take the lead and hug me tight. 
		Hold me for a while until everything finally sinks into me.
		<br/> <br/> Also, baka mahiya me so please sana ikaw hindi. HZHZHZHZHZH. Idk what's our plan for that day 
		but I would really love to spend a calm and peaceful first date with you. Maybe a date in a mahangin and calmy spot? I would like that. 
		I can just lean on ur shoulder as we talk for hours.
		<br/> <br/> Anywhere is fine but I would like to get to know you more so maybe a place where we can talk. 
		I know there are still things to discover from you the moment we meet. I wanna know if you bite your nails while thinking, 
		do your eyebrows frown when you're thinking hard about something? are your hands warm like you told me?
		<br/> <br/> I wish time could go faster but they said that love is Patient so I'll wait till the day you can read this letter.
		<br/> <br/> Love, <br.> Your Eddielyn.
		</p>
