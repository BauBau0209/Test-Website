		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'; margin-left: 250px; margin-right: 250px"> Hi. The last time we have a serious fight, It was me who kinda did something wrong.
		So I assume it's the same now? I'll never know what we fought about the time you are reading this but if I did something wrong, please don't ignore me. 
		Please don't give me the cold shoulder. If you did, I might be crying right now.
		<br/> <br/> Try explaining how much I've hurt you. Tell me why it's hurting you. I know myself, I don't think the time will come when I will hurt you intentionally.
		If I did hurt you, I might not fully understand why so, please, tell me. 
		<br/> <br/> If it was kinda your fault, it must be because of another girl. You once told me that what hurts you the most is feeling like you are not the only one. 
		I feel the same. If I was just overthinking things, please assure me just like you always do. But if you did something wrong concerning a third party, break up with me.
		<br/> <br/> I hope it won't come to that point but just know that except third party and something immoral, I can forgive you with anything. So talk to me.
		<br/> <br/> Overall, just remember, if it was my fault, talk to me or tell me if you need some time. If it was your fault, explain things and be honest with me. Pray if it's unbearable.
		<br/> <br/> Love, <br/> Your Eddielyn.
