        I don't know what's going on but you agree that everything is gonna work out in the end, right?
        <br/><br/> Maybe it's hard and sad right now but let's change it to "It's sad. For now", Ok? 
        <br/> <br/> I hope I made your heart lighter but you can message and call me anytime.
        Love, <br/> Your Eddielyn.</p>
