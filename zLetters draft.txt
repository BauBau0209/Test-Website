When you miss me
X1. 
I don't know why you miss me but yakaaappp hehe. Did we have a fight? If yes, malamang kasalanan mo. If not, maybe we can't talk at the moment? Am I busy right now? or do you just miss me? Whatever the reason, I know the current me misses you too.Â 

If we really have a fight, go read the 'when we have a misunderstanding' letter. If I'm busy, just know that I think of you from time to time. If Ikaw ang busy, paki bilisan. If miss mo lang talaga ako even though we just talked a few minutes ago, boang ka. Chz. I love youuuu. I feel so special knowing that you feel that sometimes. Missing me even though we just talked. I feel special knowing na someone loves and misses me as much as you do. I hope we can spend time again soon.

I wish you a great day today.

Love,
Your Eddielyn.

X2.
You miss me again? I wonder how long it has been since you opened the first 'When you miss me' letter. Napaisip tuloy ako if three variatians ng letters is enough hzhzhzhz. Maybe I'll add more in the future. tell me if nabasa mo na yung tatlong letters for when you miss me. 

Anyways, yakappppp hehe. Like what I told you sa first letter, if we have a fight, go read a letter about that. If I'm busy again, you can send me a message saying "I miss you". That would really put a smile on my face. Hindi ko pinapahalata pero kinikilig ako sa mga random I miss you's and I love you's from you. 

Kahapon, August 21, 2023. I sent you a random I love you and 7 mins after you replied: "I love you more". I can't explain in a more detailed way basta just know na I smiled big and mej napapadyak-padyak AHHAHAHAHHAHA aaaaaaaaaaa. Krazy. 

Pero ayon, I hope you felt better after reading this. Go send me a message if you really miss me na. Have a great day.

Love,
Your Eddielyn.

When you want to read something sweet
1. Donut...               ...leave kaC I wanna be with you for the rest of our lives.
2. Thank you for being mine. I love you.
3. I always thank God for giving you to me. Always. Every. single. personal. prayers.
4. I'm proud of who you've become, how much you've grown, and how you managed to get up from the lowest points of your life.
5. I have and will always pray for your and your family's happiness. 
6. I don't think I can love anyone else as much as I do to you. 



When we have a misunderstanding
1. Is it a serious misunderstanding or maybe tinotopak lang ako? I hope it's nothing serious.

If it was a serious fight, read the letter "When we have a serious fight"

If tinotopak lang ako, just let me think about it for some time. I know myself. It's either I'm waiting for your chat or I want to cool my head(baka gutom lang). Try asking me din if I want some time alone or If I want assurance for you. Because like what I've told you, your words can always make me feel better. 

If ikaw ang tinotopak or nagtatampo...

I have an urge na sabihin "Bahala ka jan" pero sige I'll be serious here AHHAHAHA. 

I'm not good at confrontation. Tho I am trying to be better, It's quite hard for me to admit that I was wrong and I need to say sorry. If I did hurt your feelings, tell me something like "I was kinda hurt by what you said...". that will wake me up.

Love,
Your Eddielyn.



When we have a serious fight
1. 
Hi. The last time we have a serious fight, It was me who kinda did something wrong. So I assume it's the same now? I'll never know what we fought about the time you are reading this but if I did something wrong, please don't ignore me. please don't give me the cold shoulder. If you did, I might be crying right now.

Try explaining how much I've hurt you. Tell me why it's hurting you. I know myself, I don't think the time will come when I will hurt you intentionally. If I did hurt you, I might not fully understand why so, please, tell me. 

If it was kinda your fault, it must be because of another girl. You once told me that what hurts you the most is feeling like you are not the only one. I feel the same. If I was just overthinking things, please assure me just like you always do. But if you did something wrong concerning a third party, read the letter 'when you cheated'.

Overall, just remember, if it was my fault, talk to me or tell me if you need some time. If it was your fault, explain things and be honest with me. Pray if it's unbearable.

Love,
Your Eddielyn.






When breaking up ever crossed your mind

1.
No :)
Di ka na makakahanap ng tulad ko.



When you're afraid I'm drifting away from you

1. 
I can't imagine myself falling out of love with you but if you ever feel like that, please ask me what's wrong. Maybe something triggered me again to detach from you just like last time. Or maybe I'm just having 'me time'?

Don't suffer alone. Tell me so I could try to explain and make you feel better.

Love,
Your Eddielyn.



When you wanna hear me magteksto.
1. 
Have you ever thought of how Eve was created for Adam and not Adam created for Eve?
Also, if what we have is really God's will, then I must be your Eve. I must have come from your rib. hzhzhzhz

Message me after reading this, I wanna hear your thoughts.

Love,
Your Rib.

when you had a bad day
1. Yakapppp. Days like this are normal and it's ok to feel disappointed/sad about it. Just don't dwell on it too much. We still have tomorrow and the rest of our lives to spend.

Love,
Your Eddielyn.



When you are sick
1. Awwww. My baby is sick. HZHZHZHZHZHZHZHZ. Yakapppp. I hope you are resting well. When you are reading this, I might not be able to visit you but if I can, I definitely would. I'll bring you lugaw or fruits and maybe I'll hold your hand till you fall asleep hehe.

Rest well, mahal.

Love,
Your Eddielyn.




When you had a bad grade/score
1. You must be in college na if you're reading this. Did you study enough to deserve a higher grade/score? If not, then try to give a little more effort. As long as it's not a failing grade and you don't have to retake the subject, it should be fine. But if your answer is yes, you can either complain to your prof or accept it and hope for better luck next time.

If you chose to just accept it all but you're still feeling quite disappointed of yourself, just remember na si kuya, may isang subject siyang bagsak nung college and he never aimed for latin honors pero look at him now. Currently, 100k a month ang sahod niya.

Grades are really just a number. Although education is important for more opportunities, you don't have to be harsh on yourself if you don't excel in it.

I love you.

Love,
Your Eddielyn.



When your faith starts to waiver
1. Remember the times he answered your prayers? Remember the things you used to thank him for? Remember how kind he was to you even when you didn't deserve it?

Keep reminding yourself. I love you.

Love,
Your Eddielyn.



When you need inspiration/motivation
1. You wanna marry me someday, right?

I hope that's enough to inspire you ZHHZHZHZHZHZ.

Love,
Your Eddielyn.



When you can't decide on something important.
1. Pray. I know you know this but just trust him and wait for his sign. Just remember that if the choice is may paglabag then it means no.

Love,
Your Eddielyn.



When you're crying/sad and you can't show anyone
1. Yakapppp. I love you. I don't know what's going on but you agree that everything is gonna work out in the end, right?

Maybe you it's hard and sad right now but let's change it to "It's sad. For now", Ok? 

I hope I made your heart less heavy.

Love,
Your Eddielyn.



When It's your birthday
1. Happy Birthday, mahal.

Two years since we met, hindi pa din kita nababati on your exact birthday. Now that you're reading this, I believe it's April 4, 2024? 

I hope we're still as happy as we are now. I must have gifted you something special and heartfelt just like this website na ginawa ko for you. It's currently day 2 ng paggawa ko nitong website and I still have a long way to go. I hope whatever gift I come up with para sa birthday mo is something you'll cherish forever. I hope you'll like it as much as you'll like this website (not sure pa since hindi ko pa napapakita sayo).

I wish you all the best things in the world. I pray for your health, happiness, and peace, as well as your family's. May your dreams come true with me by your side.

I love you.
 
Love,
Your Eddielyn.




When It's near my birthday
1. Hi, so it's nearing February 9?

I'm not sure if you have something for my birthday pero just a tip, I like any gifts except clothes. It can be food, skincare stuff, or something you created yourself. If we still can't meet face to face then maybe you can do something digital like this website. or maybe you can plan a date like watching a movie through Gmeet?

I would like something you made or a date you planned but I know I'll love anything as long as it's from you.

Love,
Your Eddielyn.




When It's your first day of school
Hiii. Are you nervous? Excited?

I feel like you'll answer "both". Eitherway, I'm excited for you. I hope you'll have a great time and you'll be able to find good company on your school. I must have told you loads of tips already the moment na I heard mag sstart ka na soon so I won't tell you much here on this letter.

Good luck on your studies. Please don't pressure yourself too much. One of the things that kuya taught me is that grades won't matter as much when you're working already. As long as you graduate and you have the right skills and characteristics, you can do well on the adult world.

Pero wag ka naman mag bulakbol. baka naman dahil sa sinabi ko hindi kana pumasok. Try to graduate with flying colors but don't ever be harsh to yourself for not achieving things as much as you want. 

Pero above all that, trust God na pagtatagumpayin ka niya sa school becuase you are loyal to him. Just like how he gave me to you when you asked him, he can give you your dreams.

I wish you good luck on your first day.

Love,
Your Eddielyn.






When we will finally meet each other face to face.
1. Hi. I don't know if you'll still feel nervous when we're finally about to meet but please hug me the second you see me.

I might not be able to move when I first saw you so you take the lead and hug me tight. Hold me for a while until everything finally sinks into me.

Also, baka mahiya me so please sana ikaw hindi. HZHZHZHZHZH. Idk what's our plan for that day but I would really love to spend a calm and peaceful first date with you. Maybe a picnic in a mahangin and calmy spot? I would like that. I can just lean on ur shoulder as we talk for hours.

Anywhere is fine but I would like to get to know you more so maybe a place where we can talk. I know there are still things to discover from you the moment we meet. I wanna know if you bite your nails while thinking, do your eyebrows frown when you're thinking hard about something? are your hands warm like you told me?

I wish time could go faster but they said that love is Patient so I'll wait till the day you can read this letter.

Love,
Your Eddielyn.
