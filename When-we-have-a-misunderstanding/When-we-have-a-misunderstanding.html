		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'; margin-left: 250px; margin-right: 250px"> Is it a serious misunderstanding or maybe tinotopak lang ako? 
		I hope it's nothing serious.</p>
		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'; margin-left: 250px; margin-right: 250px"> If it was a serious fight, read the letter "When we have a serious fight" <br/>
		<br/> If tinotopak lang ako, just let me think about it for some time. I know myself. It's either I'm waiting for your chat or I want to cool my head(baka gutom lang). 
		Try asking me din if I want some time alone or If I want assurance for you. Because like what I've told you, your words can always make me feel better. 
		<br/> <br/> If ikaw ang tinotopak or nagtatampo...
		<br/> <br/> I have an urge na sabihin "Bahala ka jan" pero sige I'll be serious here AHHAHAHA.
		<br/> <br/> I'm not good at confrontation. Tho I am trying to be better, It's quite hard for me to admit that I was wrong and I need to say sorry. 
		If I did hurt your feelings, tell me something like "I was kinda hurt by what you said...". that will wake me up.
		<br/> <br/> I hope we make up soon.
		<br/> <br/> Love, <br/> Your Eddielyn.</p>
