		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'; margin-left: 250px; margin-right: 250px"> I don't know why you miss me but yakaaappp hehe. 
		Did we have a fight? If yes, malamang kasalanan mo. If not, maybe we can't talk at the moment? Am I busy right now? or do you just miss me? Whatever the reason,
		I know the current me misses you too.Â </p>
		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'; margin-left: 250px; margin-right: 250px"> If we really have a fight, go read the 'when we have a misunderstanding' letter.
		If I'm busy, just know that I think of you from time to time. If Ikaw ang busy, paki bilisan. If miss mo lang talaga ako even though we just talked a few minutes ago, boang ka. 
		Chz. I love youuuu. I feel so special knowing that you feel that sometimes. Missing me even though we just talked. I feel special knowing na someone loves and misses me as much as you do. 
		I hope we can spend time again soon. </p>
		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'; margin-left: 250px; margin-right: 250px">I wish you a great day today.<p><br/>
		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'; margin-left: 250px; margin-right: 250px">Love,</p>
		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'; margin-left: 250px; margin-right: 250px">Your Eddielyn.</p>
