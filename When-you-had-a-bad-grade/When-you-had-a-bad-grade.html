		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'; margin-left: 250px; margin-right: 250px">You must be in college na if you're reading this. 
		Did you study enough to deserve a higher grade/score? If not, then try to give a little more effort. 
		As long as it's not a failing grade and you don't have to retake the subject, it should be fine. But if your answer is yes, 
		you can either complain to your prof or accept it and hope for better luck next time. <br/><br/> 
		If you chose to just accept it all but you're still feeling quite disappointed of yourself, just remember na si kuya, 
		may isang subject siyang bagsak nung college and he never aimed for latin honors pero look at him now. Currently, 100k a month ang sahod niya. <br/> <br/>
		Grades are really just a number. Although education is important for more opportunities, you don't have to be harsh on yourself if you don't excel in it. <br/> <br/>
        Love, <br/> Your Eddielyn.</p>
