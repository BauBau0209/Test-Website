		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'; margin-left: 250px; margin-right: 250px">You must be in college na if you're reading this. Eyyyy. I'm happy for you.
		Pero seriously speaking, did you study enough to deserve a higher grade/score? If not, then maybe try to give a little more effort next time? 
		Although as long as it's not a failing grade and you don't have to retake the subject, it should be fine. But if you think deserve mo mas mataas na grade, 
		you can either complain to your prof or accept it and hope for better luck next time. <br/><br/> 
		If you chose to just accept it all even if you're still feeling quite disappointed, just remember na si kuya, 
		may isang subject siyang bagsak nung college and he never aimed for latin honors pero look at him now. Currently, 100k a month ang sahod niya. <br/> <br/>
		Grades are really just a number. Although education is important for more opportunities, you don't have to be harsh on yourself if you don't excel in it.
		Pero wag ka namang magbulakbol.<br/> <br/>
        Love, <br/> Your Eddielyn.</p>
