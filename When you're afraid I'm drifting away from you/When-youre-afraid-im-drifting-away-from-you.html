		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'; margin-left: 250px; margin-right: 250px"> I can't imagine myself falling out of love with you but if you ever feel like that, 
		please ask me what's wrong. Maybe something triggered me again to detach from you just like last time. Or maybe I'm just having 'me time'?
		<br/> <br/> Don't suffer alone. Tell me so I could try to explain and make you feel better.
		<br/> <br/> Love, <br.> Your Eddielyn.
