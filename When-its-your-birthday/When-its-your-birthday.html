		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'; margin-left: 250px; margin-right: 250px">Happy Birthday, mahal. <br/> <br/>
        Two years since we met, hindi pa din kita nababati on your exact birthday. Now that you're reading this, I believe it's April 4, 2024? 
		<br/> <br/> I hope we're still as happy as we are now. I must have gifted you something special and heartfelt just like this website na ginawa ko for you. 
        It's currently day 2 ng paggawa ko nitong website and I still have a long way to go. I hope whatever gift I come up with para sa birthday mo is something you'll cherish forever. 
        I hope you'll like it as much as you'll like this website (not sure pa since hindi ko pa napapakita sayo).
		<br/> <br/> I wish you all the best things in the world. I pray for your health, happiness, and peace, as well as your family's. May your dreams come true with me by your side.
        <br/> <br/> I love you.
        <br/> <br/> Love, <br.> Your Eddielyn.
