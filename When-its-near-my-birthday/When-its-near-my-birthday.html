		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'; margin-left: 250px; margin-right: 250px">Hi, so it's nearing February 9? I don't really know what to say but
		I assume you would want ideas ano ireregalo?<br/> <br/>
		I'm not sure if you have something for my birthday pero just a tip, I like any gifts except clothes. It can be food, skincare stuff, or something you created yourself. 
		If we still can't meet face to face then maybe you can do something digital like this gift. gawan mo din ako website (chz) or maybe you can plan a date like watching a movie through Gmeet?
		<br/> <br/> I would like something you made or a date you planned but I know I'll love anything as long as it's from you.
        <br/> <br/> Love, <br.> Your Eddielyn.
		</p>
